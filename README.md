This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift's async/await feature: improper error handling. The `fetchData` function uses async/await to fetch data from a URL.  However, the error handling within the `Task` block simply prints the error to the console without providing robust error recovery. This example shows how to improve error handling to gracefully manage potential network issues or other errors.
